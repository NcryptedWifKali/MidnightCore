# MidnightCore: By OldMidnight[UNITY]

## Description
This module is an All-In-One package for the MidnightModule series. It currently Contains: 
### MidnightFonts
* This Package allows you to systemless-ly switch between fonts On-The-Go. Fonts are downloaded, applied and cleaned up at the same time, so no font zips are left lying around. Choose from over 40 Fonts!
### MidnightMedia
* This package allows you to Systemless-ly switch Media files such as boot animations, System UI sounds, lock screen sounds etc. Just a quick Reboot and you're good to go! Choose from a range of devices to apply files from!
### MidnightMake: MidnightFonts Add-On
* A simple add-on for MidnightFonts that allows you to create recovery flashable zips of the fonts available. This is for those who are switching ROM's or are leaving root behind or whatever reason!
### MidnightMisc
* This package gives users a couple of tools and utilities that make debugging and other things easier. It is a home for any modifications or tools that do not need a home of their own. Will be regularly updated with user requests!
### MidnightDNS
* This package allows you to systemlessly change your DNS server for speed, security, protection or privacy benefits.

After flashing, type 'midnight' in a terminal to begin.

#### Note:
* All files available in this module are all being hosted by me, so the font list and media list will be maintained regularly and updated.
* For details on joining the beta stream, type 'setbeta -h' or 'setbeta --help' in a terminal.
