# MidnightCore: By OldMidnight[UNITY]

## Description
This module is an All-In-One package for the MidnightModule series. It currently Contains: 
### MidnightFonts
* This Package allows you to systemless-ly switch between fonts On-The-Go. Fonts are downloaded, applied and cleaned up at the same time, so no font zips are left lying around. Choose from over 30 Fonts!
### MidnightMedia
* This package allows you to Systemless-ly switch Media files such as boot animations, System UI sounds, lock screen sounds etc. Just a quick Reboot and you're good to go! Choose from a range of devices to apply files from!
### MidnightMake: MidnightFonts Add-On
* A simple add-on for MidnightFonts that allows you to create recovery flashable zips of the fonts available. This is for those who are switching ROM's or are leaving root behind or whatever reason!

After flashing, type 'midnight' in a terminal to begin.

#### Note:
* All files available in this module are all being hosted by me, so the font list and media list will be maintained regularly and updated.
